                <p>This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                The project lasted from 2005-2009.</p>

                <p>Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha stayed in a mango grove in the country of Mithilā.</p>
                <p>At this time the Venerable Sujāta had just gone forth and cut off his hair. He came to the Buddha, payed homage by touching the Buddha’s feet and sat down to one side. The Buddha told the other monks: ‘This son of a good family, Sujāta, is splendid in two ways: First, his appearance is of extraordinary beauty, his features exceptionally handsome. Second, he was able to cut off his hair and cover his body with the robe. Feeling deeply that family life was all too ephemeral, he went forth and pursued the way. He ended all afflictions, is filled with purity, has liberated his mind [from desire], has liberated his wisdom [from ignorance].</p>
                <p>In this very body he has attained the unconditioned, forever ended [the cycle of] life and death. Established in the pure life, he will not have to endure another existence’.</p>
                <p>Having said this, the Buddha spoke this verse:</p>
                <lg>
                    <l>The monk, always calm and concentrated / abandons desire and life and death;//</l>
                    <l> he abides in his final body / he can defeat Māra’s armies,//</l>
                    <l> training his mind, he breaks all fetters / his uprightness is without equal.//</l>
                </lg>
                <p>When the Buddha had finished preaching this sutta, the monks, having listened to what he had said, were happy and practised accordingly.</p>
