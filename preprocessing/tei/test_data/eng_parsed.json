He came to the Buddha, payed homage by touching the Buddha\u2019s feet and sat down to one side. The Buddha told the other monks: \u2018This son of a good family, Suj\u0101ta, is splendid in two ways: First, his appearance is of extraordinary beauty, his features exceptionally handsome. Second, he was able to cut off his hair and cover his body with the robe. Feeling deeply that family life was all too ephemeral, he went forth and pursued the way. He ended all afflictions, is filled with purity, has liberated his mind [from desire], has liberated his wisdom [from ignorance].In this very body he has attained the unconditioned, forever ended [the cycle of] life and death. Established in the pure life, he will not have to endure another existence\u2019.Having said this, the Buddha spoke this verse:The monk, always calm and concentrated / abandons desire and life and death;// he abides in his final body / he can defeat M\u0101ra\u2019s armies,// training his mind, he breaks all fetters / his uprightness is without equal.//When the Buddha had finished preaching this sutta, the monks, having listened to what he had said, were happy and practised accordingly.", "availability": "All texts used with permission.
